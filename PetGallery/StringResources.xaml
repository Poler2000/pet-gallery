    <system:String x:Key="About">The goal of Pet Gallery is to let you discover thousands of adorable cat and dog images. You can search for images matching specified criteria and create your own collections. It is possible thanks to amazing APIs: thecatapi.com and thedogapi.com. The app itself was created using C# and WPF for use on Windows. It is my first bigger project using WPF and MVVM, so the source code definitely has it's flaws, but I encourage you to check it out anyway!\nPoler</system:String>
